# vampire_benchmarks
A repository of benchmarks produced by and used by the Vampire team

Please add new benchmarks in their own directory with a README describing 
- Their source/some context
- What features they are targetting (which options etc)
- The version (commit) of Vampire that they were most recently tested with
