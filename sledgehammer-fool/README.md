# Some SMT-LIB problems generated by Sledgehammer

These problems express various properties of (co)algebraic datatypes and are written in the SMT-LIB 2 syntax. All 152 problems contain quantification over booleans, boolean arguments in function/predicate applications and if-then-else expressions. These examples were generated and given to us by Jasmin Blanchette, following the recent work on reasoning about (co)datatypes.

These problems were used in papers

* [The Vampire and the FOOL](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2854065.2854071) by E. Kotelnikov, L. Kovacs, G. Reger and A. Voronkov, published at CPP 2016;
* [A Clausal Normal Form Translation for FOOL](https://easychair.org/publications/paper/1PB2) by E. Kotelnikov, L. Kovacs, M. Suda and A. Voronkov, published at GCAI 2016.

Vampire was run with `--mode casc` and `--mode cast_sat` separately on each problem.
